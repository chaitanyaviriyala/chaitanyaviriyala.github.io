Hey! My name is Chaitanya Krishna Viriyala and this is my Personal Website/Portfolio. I have an Engineering Degree from Ecole Centrale Nantes and have been in the data field for the last 5 years.

I love working with data to solve problems and make things better. I have studied about data, signals, and electronics, and I've been lucky to work in cool places across France.

My work is about making buildings smarter and saving energy. In the past, I helped doctors with better information, and built a amrketplace for animals. I've worked with great teams at GreenTwins, APICL, Daisun, and others, where I've learned to use lots of different computer tools to manage and understand data.

My skills include Python, PySpark, Airflow, Elastic Search, Azure/AWS to name a few and I also use other tools to organize and keep data safe and easy to use on the internet. I'm always learning new things and trying to get better at what I do.

This website is where you can see what I’ve done and what I’m all about. Whether you're someone who wants to work with me, someone who's into technology, or just curious, you're welcome here. Let’s talk and make something great together!

Outside of that, I like sharing code on GitHub, where you'll find both completed projects and works in progress. You can also find me at my 
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chaitanya-krishna-viriyala-3956b011/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> posting updates every so often.
