Hey! My name is Chaitanya Krishna Viriyala and this is my Personal Website/Portfolio.

Currently, I'm a graduate student pursuing[ DATASIM (Data analysis and applications in signal and image processing)](https://www.ec-nantes.fr/engineering-programme-diplome-dingenieur/course-specialisations-yrs-23/data-analysis-and-applications-in-signal-and-image-processing) at [Ecole Centrale de Nantes](https://www.ec-nantes.fr), a graduate program with a curriculum focusing extensively on images, design and innovation. Most recently, from April 2020 to September 2020, I've worked at CYME, a startup based in Montpellier. Previously, I've had a chance to study at [Mahindra Ecole Centrale](https://www.mahindraecolecentrale.edu.in) and intern at [SCEE team in Centrale Supelec Rennes](http://www-scee.rennes.supelec.fr/wp/) during my bachelors.

During my term at [CYME](www.cyme.io),  I have developed Algorithms for PEAKTO, the toolbox and worked extensively on Image Duplicates, Near Duplicates, Color Palette Detection and Face Detection. I was supervised by the founders of the company Matthieu Kopp and Thomas. 

Right now, I am working on improving Ultrasound Images as a part of Plane Wave Imaging Challenge under the guidance of [Prof. Diana Mateus](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kr_GYOsAAAAJ)

Outside of that, I like sharing code on GitHub, where you'll find both completed projects and works in progress. You can also find me at my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chaitanya-krishna-viriyala-3956b011/) posting updates every so often.

Interested? Contact me at [chaitanya.viriyala@eleves.ec-nantes.fr](mailto:chaitanya.viriyala@eleves.ec-nantes.fr)
