Hey! My name is Chaitanya Krishna Viriyala and this is my Personal Website/Portfolio.

Currently, I'm a graduate student pursuing <a href="https://www.ec-nantes.fr/engineering-programme-diplome-dingenieur/course-specialisations-yrs-23/data-analysis-and-applications-in-signal-and-image-processing" target="_blank"> DATASIM (Data analysis and applications in signal and image processing)</a>
at <a href="https://www.ec-nantes.fr" target="_blank">Ecole Centrale de Nantes</a>, a graduate program with a curriculum focusing extensively on images, design and innovation. I'll be graduated in September 2021.

Most recently, from April 2021 to September 2021, I've been working at <a href="https://rhisa.eu" target="_blank">RHISA</a>, an early stage starup based in Paris as a Machine Learning Engineer. As a part of my job, I work extensively on providing NLP solutions, like : development of information extraction from medical reports. I've built some end to end pipelines for Negation Detection, Medical NER (Named Entity Recognition) & leverage the use of ontology to structure medial data coming from the hospitals. I worked closely with the co founders of the company Pierre, Amine and Sebastian.

During last summer, from April 2020 to September 2020, I've worked at <a href="https://cyme.io" target="_blank">CYME</a>, a startup based in Montpellier.
During my term at <a href="https://cyme.io" target="_blank">CYME</a>,  I have developed Algorithms for PEAKTO, the toolbox and worked extensively on Image Duplicates, Near Duplicates, Color Palette Detection and Face Detection. I was supervised by the founders of the company Matthieu Kopp and Thomas. 


Previously, I've had a chance to study at <a href="https://www.mahindraecolecentrale.edu.in" target="_blank">Mahindra Ecole Centrale</a> and intern at <a href="http://www-scee.rennes.supelec.fr/wp/" target="_blank">SCEE team in Centrale Supelec Rennes</a> during my bachelors.


As a part of academic projects, I am working on developing a GUI for processing ECG signals, as there is no tool for automatically converting scanned image to signals under the guidance of <a href="https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=Vkr8yxkAAAAJ&hl=fr" target="_blank">Prof. Sa√Ød Mouassoui</a>. I worked on improving Ultrasound Images as a part of Plane Wave Imaging Challenge under the guidance of <a href="https://www.ls2n.fr/annuaire/Diana%20MATEUS/" target="_blank">Prof. Diana Mateus</a>. 


Outside of that, I like sharing code on GitHub, where you'll find both completed projects and works in progress. You can also find me at my 
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chaitanya-krishna-viriyala-3956b011/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> posting updates every so often.
